## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Micah
I'm currently a QC Microbiologist Associate with an passion for learning about data.  I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a degree in Biology and looking to further develop my skills in data analytics and visualization.  

Recently, I've been taking a variety of classes and trying my hand in a number of things.  In the past year I've taken classes in Linear Algebra, Data Structures and Algorithms, Java Foundations, SQl with Google Big Query, and currently enrolled in a Data Science and Machine learning in R bootcamp.  Please enjoy and feel free to interact as I display here what I learn!
