## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Micah
I'm currently a student at USC Marshall with an passion for learning about data.  I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a degree in Biology and looking to further develop my skills in data analytics and visualization.  

Recently, I've been taking a variety of classes and trying my hand in a number of things.  In the past year I've taken classes in Linear Algebra, Data Structures and Algorithms, Java Foundations, SQL with Google Big Query, and currently my course work includes Statistical Computing and Data Visualization, Data Driven Decision Making, Data, Models, and Effective Decisions, and SQL Databases for Business Analysts.  Please feel free to enjoy the projects that I've been doing and accompany me on my learning journey!
